- The guiding question/ motivation for your analysis

I wants to know whcih teams have won the Championship during the years.

*** Does a team who play more games played in the league have a greater chance to become/enter World Championship and win ?

- An obstacle that you encountered, and how you resolved it

Trying to load the data from kaggle(website) into R failed, so I downloaed file and import locally

- The key insights, conclusions, or takeaway with respect to your guiding question/motivation based on your work

Base on the Number of games different League played Graph, we can see that LCK (South Korea) have played most competitive matches out of all other different regions with total of 1445, and out of that, SKT played 403 games, and SSG played 322 games. No wonder they are the best team in the world.

[KaggleData](https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends#matchinfo.csv)
```{r}
# clean up workspace environment
rm(list = ls())

# all packages used for the assignment

##### Loading data from Wikipedia into R is easy.
It have the teams that have won the championship and the region that won the championship
```{r}

page <- ("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends_World_Championship#Overview")
topFour <- page %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)

head(topFour[[3]])
head(topFour[[4]])
```


##### Trying to load Kaggle data that's online but ending in csv into R, but failed.
```{r}
pageK <- ("https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends#matchinfo.csv")
tableListK <- pageK %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)

head(tableListK)
```

##### Loading csv file locally
```{r}
matchData <- read.csv('/Users/jack/Desktop/STAT 184/matchinfo.csv')

head(matchData)
```

##### Find out the number of games played by each league
```{r}
numLeague <-
  matchData %>%
  group_by(League) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
numLeague
```

```{r}

ggplot(data=numLeague,aes(x=League,y=count ,fill=League))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity',position='stack', width=1)+
  ggtitle("Number of games different League played")
```
##### By looking at the graph, we can see that LCK (South Korea) have played most competitive matches out of all other different regions

```{r}
numType <-
  matchData %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
numType
```


```{r}
LCK <- 
  matchData %>%
  filter(League == "LCK")
head (LCK)
```

##### All the matches that SKT (SK Telecom T1) have played
```{r}
BlueSKT <- 
  matchData %>%
  filter( grepl(pattern = "SKT", blueTeamTag))
BlueSKT

RedSKT <- 
  matchData %>%
  filter( grepl(pattern = "SKT", redTeamTag))
RedSKT

SKT<-
  rbind(x = BlueSKT, y = RedSKT)
SKT

```

##### All the matches that SSG (Samsung Galaxy) have played
```{r}
BlueSSG <- 
  matchData %>%
  filter( grepl(pattern = "SSG", blueTeamTag))
BlueSSG

RedSSG <- 
  matchData %>%
  filter( grepl(pattern = "SSG", redTeamTag))
RedSSG

SSG<-
  full_join(x = BlueSSG, y = RedSSG )
SSG
```

##### To see what is the longest gamelength everplayed and the shortest gamelength everplayed
```{r}
gameLength<- 
  matchData%>%
  select(gamelength)
min(gameLength)
max(gameLength)
```

##### The number of the wins by each side (Red/Blue)
```{r}
mod1 <- party::ctree (bResult ~ gamelength+rResult, data = LCK)

plot(mod1, type = "simple")

mod2 <- party::ctree (rResult ~ gamelength+bResult, data = LCK)

plot(mod2, type = "simple")


```



##### Trying to find out which team wins using ifelse function, But failed.
```{r}
blueWins = 1
blueLose = 0
blueResult <- 
  LCK%>%
  select(bResult)
ifelse ( blueResult == "1",blueWins, blueLose  )
```
